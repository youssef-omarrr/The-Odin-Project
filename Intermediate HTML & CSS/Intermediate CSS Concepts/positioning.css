/* The difference between static and relative:

 -Static is the default position of every element, 
 and properties top, right, bottom, and left do not affect the position of the element. 
 
 -Relative on the other hand is pretty much the same as static, 
 but properties top, right...(etc.) displace the element relative to its normal position 
 in the flow of the document. */


/* position: absolute allows you to position something at an exact point
  on the screen without disturbing the other elements around it.
  (the element will be removed from the normal document flow) 
  
  !! elements that are removed from the normal flow of the document donâ€™t affect other
   elements and are also not affected by other elements.*/


/* Fixed elements are also removed from the normal flow of the document 
   and are positioned relative to the viewport.
    You basically use top, right, bottom, and left properties to position it,
    and it will stay there as the user scrolls. This is especially useful for things
    like navigation bars and floating chat buttons. */

/* Sticky elements will act like normal elements until you scroll past them, 
    then they start behaving like fixed elements. */
