# 1. **Idempotency in Web APIs:**
**Key Concepts & Principles**  

#### **Idempotency**  
1. **Definition**:  
   - An operation is **idempotent** if performing it multiple times produces the same result as a single execution.  
   - Example: Sending the same `PUT /users/123` request twice updates the user to the same state as one request.  

2. **Idempotent vs. Non-Idempotent HTTP Methods**:  
   | **Method** | **Idempotent?** | **Description**                              |  
   |------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|  
   | **GET**    | Yes              | Retrieves data; no state change.             |  
   | **PUT**    | Yes              | Replaces a resource; repeated calls have no additional effect. |  
   | **DELETE** | Yes              | Deletes a resource; subsequent calls return `404`. |  
   | **POST**   | No               | Creates new resources; duplicates may cause unintended side effects. |  
   | **PATCH**  | Depends          | Non-idempotent if partial updates are state-dependent. |  

3. **Importance**:  
   - **Reliability**: Prevents duplicate side effects (e.g., double charges in payments).  
   - **Retry Safety**: Allows clients to safely retry failed requests (e.g., network timeouts).  

---

#### **Implementing Idempotency**  
1. **Idempotency Keys**:  
   - Clients send a unique key (e.g., `Idempotency-Key: abc123`) in headers.  
   - The server caches the result of the first request and returns it for subsequent duplicates.  

2. **Server-Side Checks**:  
   - Track processed keys (e.g., in Redis) to detect duplicates.  
   - Example Flow:  
     - Client sends `POST /payments` with `Idempotency-Key: abc123`.  
     - Server checks if `abc123` exists:  
       - **Exists**: Return cached response.  
       - **New**: Process payment, store result, return response.  

3. **Idempotent POST Workarounds**:  
   - Use `POST` to create resources with client-generated IDs (e.g., `POST /orders/{id}`).  
   - Treat duplicate IDs as idempotent (return `409 Conflict` if ID exists).  

---

#### **Challenges & Solutions**  
1. **Key Management**:  
   - **Problem**: Storing keys indefinitely consumes resources.  
   - **Solution**: Set expiration times (e.g., 24 hours).  

2. **Concurrency**:  
   - **Problem**: Race conditions if duplicate requests arrive simultaneously.  
   - **Solution**: Use locks or database transactions.  

3. **State-Dependent Operations**:  
   - **Problem**: `PATCH` operations may not be idempotent if updates depend on current state.  
   - **Solution**: Design updates to be absolute (e.g., `PUT`) or use versioning (e.g., `ETag`).  

---

#### **Use Cases**  
1. **Payment Processing**: Avoid double charges from retries.  
2. **Order Placement**: Prevent duplicate orders.  
3. **Distributed Systems**: Ensure consistency across microservices.  

---

### Example Exam Questions & Answers  
1. **Q**: Explain why `PUT` is idempotent, but `POST` is not.  
   **A**:  
   - `PUT` replaces a resource entirely; repeated requests leave it in the same state.  
   - `POST` creates a new resource each time, leading to duplicates.  

2. **Q**: How does an idempotency key prevent duplicate payments?  
   **A**:  
   - The server associates the key with the first request’s result. Subsequent requests with the same key return the cached result without reprocessing.  

3. **Q**: Is `DELETE /users/123` idempotent? Justify your answer.  
   **A**:  
   - Yes. The first call deletes the user (returns `200`/`204`). Subsequent calls return `404`, but the server state remains unchanged.  

4. **Q**: Design an idempotent API endpoint for uploading files.  
   **A**:  
   - Use `PUT /files/{file_id}` with client-generated `file_id`. The server overwrites the file if `file_id` exists, ensuring idempotency.  

5. **Q**: What is a drawback of using idempotency keys?  
   **A**:  
   - Storage overhead for tracking keys and potential complexity in handling expiration/cleanup.

# 2. **Caching:**
**Key Concepts & Strategies**  


#### **Caching Overview**  
1. **Definition**:  
   - **Cache**: A temporary storage layer that holds frequently accessed data to reduce latency, server load, and bandwidth usage.  
   - **Goal**: Improve performance by serving data faster than retrieving it from the primary source (e.g., database, API).  

2. **Cache Types**:  
   - **Web Caching**:  
     - **Browser Cache**: Stores static assets (CSS, images) locally on the user’s device.  
     - **CDN Cache**: Distributes content globally via edge servers (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai).  
   - **Database Caching**:  
     - **Query Cache**: Stores results of frequent database queries (e.g., MySQL Query Cache).  
     - **In-Memory Cache**: Uses RAM for fast access (e.g., Redis, Memcached).  
   - **Application-Level Caching**:  
     - **Object Caching**: Caches serialized objects (e.g., user sessions, API responses).  

---

#### **Caching Mechanisms**  
1. **Cache Expiration**:  
   - **TTL (Time-to-Live)**: Sets a lifespan for cached data (e.g., expire after 1 hour).  
   - **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Evicts least-recently accessed data when the cache is full.  

2. **Cache Validation**:  
   - **ETag**: A hash of the resource; the server checks if it matches the client’s version.  
   - **Last-Modified**: Timestamp indicating when the resource was last updated.  

3. **Cache Invalidation**:  
   - **Write-Through**: Updates cache and database simultaneously.  
   - **Write-Around**: Writes directly to the database, bypassing the cache.  
   - **Write-Back**: Writes to cache first, then asynchronously to the database.  

---

#### **Web Caching Strategies**  
1. **HTTP Caching Headers**:  
   - `Cache-Control`: Directives like `max-age`, `no-cache`, `public/private`.  
   - Example: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600`.  
2. **CDN Caching**:  
   - Caches static/dynamic content at edge locations closer to users.  
3. **Client-Side Caching**:  
   - Leverages browser storage (e.g., `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`).  

---

#### **Database Caching**  
1. **Query Caching**:  
   - Stores results of frequent SQL queries (e.g., MySQL’s `query_cache_type`).  
   - **Drawback**: Invalidated on table updates, leading to stale data.  
2. **Materialized Views**:  
   - Precomputed query results stored as tables (e.g., PostgreSQL materialized views).  
3. **In-Memory Databases**:  
   - Use RAM for ultra-fast access (e.g., Redis for session storage).  

---

#### **Benefits vs. Challenges**  
| **Benefits**                          | **Challenges**                          |  
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|  
| Faster response times.                | Stale data if not invalidated properly. |  
| Reduced server/database load.         | Cache coherence issues (consistency).   |  
| Lower bandwidth costs (CDN).          | Increased complexity in architecture.   |  

---

#### **Security Considerations**  
1. **Cache Poisoning**:  
   - Attackers inject malicious data into the cache.  
   - **Mitigation**: Validate inputs and restrict cacheable endpoints.  
2. **Side-Channel Attacks**:  
   - Exploit timing differences (e.g., cached vs. uncached responses).  
   - **Mitigation**: Uniform response times for sensitive operations.  

---

### Example Exam Questions & Answers  
1. **Q**: Compare browser caching and CDN caching.  
   **A**:  
   - **Browser Cache**: Stores assets locally on a user’s device for faster reloads.  
   - **CDN Cache**: Stores assets on global edge servers to reduce latency for users worldwide.  

2. **Q**: What is cache invalidation, and why is it challenging?  
   **A**:  
   - **Invalidation**: Removing/updating stale data in the cache.  
   - **Challenge**: Ensuring consistency between cache and source-of-truth (e.g., database).  

3. **Q**: How does the `Cache-Control` header improve web performance?  
   **A**:  
   - It specifies how long a resource can be cached (`max-age`), whether it’s public/private, and when to revalidate (`no-cache`), reducing redundant server requests.  

4. **Q**: Explain the trade-off between write-through and write-around caching strategies.  
   **A**:  
   - **Write-Through**: Ensures cache consistency but adds write latency.  
   - **Write-Around**: Reduces cache pollution but risks stale reads until the cache is updated.  

5. **Q**: When would you use Redis over Memcached?  
   **A**:  
   - **Redis**: Offers persistence, data structures (e.g., lists, sets), and pub/sub functionality.  
   - **Memcached**: Better for simple key-value caching with horizontal scaling.  

---

### Key Takeaways for Exam Preparation  
- **Caching Types**: Understand web (browser/CDN), database (query/object), and application-level caching.  
- **Mechanisms**: Focus on TTL, LRU, ETag, and HTTP headers (`Cache-Control`).  
- **Trade-Offs**: Balance performance gains vs. complexity, consistency, and security risks.  
- **Tools**: Know Redis, Memcached, CDNs, and database-specific caching features.

# 3. **Failover:**
**Key Concepts & Strategies**  

#### **1. Definition & Purpose**
- **Failover**: Automatic switching to a backup system (secondary/standby) when the primary system fails.  
- **Goal**: Minimize downtime, ensure continuous service availability (high availability).  

---

#### **2. Key Concepts**
- **System Redundancy**:  
  - Duplicate components (servers, networks, databases) to eliminate single points of failure.  
  - Types:  
    - **Hardware redundancy**: Backup servers, power supplies.  
    - **Data redundancy**: Replication (e.g., databases, storage).  
    - **Network redundancy**: Multiple ISP connections.  

- **High Availability (HA)**:  
  - Systems designed to achieve ~99.9% ("three nines") or higher uptime.  
  - Failover is a critical HA mechanism.  

- **Failover Mechanisms**:  
  - **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Primary/secondary systems exchange regular "heartbeat" signals. Missing heartbeats trigger failover.  
  - **Health Checks**: Automated scripts/test traffic to verify system health.  
  - **Virtual IP Addresses**: Traffic rerouted to a backup IP if the primary fails.  
  - **Load Balancers**: Distribute traffic; reroute if a node fails (e.g., AWS Elastic Load Balancer).  

- **Failover Types**:  
  - **Automatic vs. Manual**: Automatic is faster but requires robust detection.  
  - **Active-Passive**: Backup remains idle until failure (e.g., standby database).  
  - **Active-Active**: All nodes handle traffic; failure redistributes load (e.g., cloud web servers).  

---

#### **3. Examples of Failover**
- **DNS Failover**: Redirects traffic to a backup server if the primary’s IP becomes unresponsive.  
- **Database Replication**: Real-time sync between primary and replica databases (e.g., MySQL Master-Slave).  
- **Cloud Services**: AWS Auto Scaling replaces unhealthy instances automatically.  

---

#### **4. Challenges**
- **Failover Time**: Delay during switchover (must be minimal for critical systems).  
- **Data Consistency**: Ensuring backups have up-to-date data (e.g., via synchronous replication).  
- **False Positives**: Overly sensitive failure detection may trigger unnecessary failovers.  

---

### **Example Exam Questions & Answers**

#### **1. Short Answer**
**Q**: What is the difference between active-passive and active-active failover?  
**A**:  
- **Active-Passive**: Backup systems remain idle until the primary fails.  
- **Active-Active**: All systems handle traffic simultaneously; failure redistributes load to remaining nodes.  

---

#### **2. Scenario-Based**  
**Q**: A company’s web server crashes. How does a load balancer enable failover?  
**A**:  
The load balancer detects the server’s failure via health checks, stops routing traffic to it, and redirects requests to healthy servers, ensuring uninterrupted service.  

---

#### **3. Technical Explanation**  
**Q**: Explain how heartbeat monitoring works in failover systems.  
**A**:  
Primary and secondary systems exchange periodic "heartbeat" signals. If the secondary stops receiving heartbeats, it assumes the primary has failed and takes over its responsibilities.  

---

#### **4. Compare/Contrast**  
**Q**: What are the pros and cons of automatic vs. manual failover?  
**A**:  
- **Automatic**: Faster recovery but risks false triggers.  
- **Manual**: Safer (human validation) but slower, leading to longer downtime.  

---

#### **5. Real-World Application**  
**Q**: How does database replication support failover?  
**A**:  
Replication ensures the backup database mirrors the primary. If the primary fails, the replica can take over with minimal data loss (if using synchronous replication).  

---

### **Key Takeaways for Exam**  
- Understand **failover types** (active-active vs. active-passive) and their use cases.  
- Link failover to **high availability** and redundancy strategies.  
- Be able to explain detection mechanisms (heartbeat, health checks) and challenges (data consistency).  
        
# 4. **MVC (Model-View-Controller):**
**Key Concepts & Principles**  

#### **1. Definition & Purpose**  
- **MVC**: A software design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components:  
  - **Model**: Manages data and business logic.  
  - **View**: Handles data presentation and user interface.  
  - **Controller**: Processes user input, interacts with the Model, and updates the View.  
- **Goal**: Promote separation of concerns, improve maintainability, and enable modular development.  

---

#### **2. Key Components**  
1. **Model**:  
   - Represents data and business rules (e.g., database interactions, calculations).  
   - Notifies the View of changes (e.g., via observers).  
   - Example: A `User` class that validates and saves user data to a database.  

2. **View**:  
   - Displays data to the user (e.g., HTML templates, UI components).  
   - Receives updates from the Model.  
   - Example: A webpage showing a user’s profile information.  

3. **Controller**:  
   - Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View.  
   - **Responsibilities**:  
     - Receives user input (e.g., HTTP requests, button clicks).  
     - Updates the Model based on input.  
     - Selects the appropriate View to render.  
   - Example: A `UserController` handling form submissions to create a new user.  

---

#### **3. Workflow Example**  
1. **User interacts with the View** (e.g., submits a login form).  
2. **Controller** receives the input, validates it, and updates the **Model** (e.g., checks credentials).  
3. **Model** processes data (e.g., verifies password hash) and notifies the **View** of changes.  
4. **View** updates based on the Model’s data (e.g., displays "Login Successful" or an error message).  

---

#### **4. MVC in Web Frameworks**  
- **Examples**:  
  - **Ruby on Rails**: Controllers handle routing, Models manage ActiveRecord, Views use ERB templates.  
  - **Django (Python)**: Follows MTV (Model-Template-View), analogous to MVC.  
  - **Spring MVC (Java)**: Uses `@Controller` annotations to handle HTTP requests.  
- **Key Benefits**:  
  - Reusable components (e.g., Models can be reused across different Views).  
  - Parallel development (frontend/backend teams work independently).  

---

#### **5. Controller Responsibilities (Deep Dive)**  
- **Input Handling**:  
  - Parse HTTP requests (e.g., form data, URL parameters).  
  - Validate user input (e.g., check for empty fields).  
- **Business Logic Coordination**:  
  - Call Model methods to process data (e.g., `User.save()`).  
  - Handle errors (e.g., database failures).  
- **View Selection**:  
  - Decide which View to render (e.g., redirect to a success page or reload the form on error).  

---

#### **6. Common Misconceptions**  
- **MVC ≠ Layered Architecture**: MVC is a presentation-layer pattern, not a full-stack architecture.  
- **Fat Controller Anti-Pattern**: Avoid placing business logic in Controllers; it belongs in Models.  

---

### **Example Exam Questions & Answers**  

#### **1. Short Answer**  
**Q**: What are the three components of MVC, and what is the Controller’s role?  
**A**:  
- **Model**: Manages data and business logic.  
- **View**: Handles UI and data presentation.  
- **Controller**: Processes user input, updates the Model, and selects the View.  

---

#### **2. Scenario-Based**  
**Q**: A user submits a registration form. Explain how MVC components interact in this scenario.  
**A**:  
1. **View** sends the form data to the **Controller**.  
2. **Controller** validates the input and asks the **Model** to save the new user.  
3. **Model** saves data to the database and notifies the **Controller** of success/failure.  
4. **Controller** selects a **View** (e.g., a success page or error message).  

---

#### **3. Compare/Contrast**  
**Q**: How does MVC differ from MVP (Model-View-Presenter)?  
**A**:  
- **MVC**: Controller handles input and updates the Model; View observes Model changes.  
- **MVP**: Presenter mediates between View and Model; View is passive and updated by the Presenter.  

---

#### **4. Technical Explanation**  
**Q**: Why should business logic reside in the Model, not the Controller?  
**A**:  
Placing business logic in the Model ensures reusability (e.g., the same logic can be used by multiple Controllers or Views) and maintains separation of concerns.  

---

#### **5. Real-World Application**  
**Q**: How would you implement a "delete item" feature using MVC in a web app?  
**A**:  
1. **View**: A button triggers a DELETE request to the Controller.  
2. **Controller**: Receives the request, calls `ItemModel.delete(id)`.  
3. **Model**: Deletes the item from the database.  
4. **Controller**: Redirects to a View showing the updated item list.  

---

### **Key Takeaways for Exam**  
- **Controller**: Input handler, Model updater, View selector.  
- **Separation of Concerns**: Model (data), View (UI), Controller (logic flow).  
- **Frameworks**: Recognize MVC patterns in tools like Ruby on Rails, Django, or Spring MVC.
