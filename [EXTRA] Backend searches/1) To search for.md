3. **Webhooks:**
    
    - **Webhooks**: Real-time communication method where one system sends data to another system via HTTP callbacks.
        
    - **Search Topics**: Webhooks, real-time APIs, HTTP callbacks.
        
4. **HTTP Authentication:**
    
    - Authentication data is typically sent in the **Header** of an HTTP request.
        
    - **Search Topics**: HTTP headers, authentication methods, OAuth, JWT.
        
5. **Stateless Servers:**
    
    - **Stateless**: The server does not maintain any session data between requests.
        
    - **Search Topics**: Stateless web servers, REST architecture, session management in web applications.

### **Concurrency and Threading:**

6. **Read-Write Lock Mechanisms:**
    
    - **Reader-Writer Lock**: Allows multiple readers but ensures only one writer at a time.
        
    - **Search Topics**: Reader-Writer lock, synchronization primitives, concurrent programming.
        
7. **Locks and Synchronization:**
    
    - **Locks**: Used to prevent race conditions and ensure consistency when multiple threads access shared data.
        
    - **Search Topics**: Locks in concurrency, mutexes, synchronization tools, deadlock prevention.
        
8. **Atomic Operations in Database Transactions:**
    
    - **Atomic**: A transaction must complete fully or have no effect at all.
        
    - **Search Topics**: ACID properties, atomicity in transactions, database transaction management.
        
9. **Database Isolation Levels (Read Committed vs Serializable):**
    
    - **Read Committed**: Allows higher concurrency with fewer locks, but less isolation.
        
    - **Serializable**: Provides the highest isolation but often reduces concurrency.
        
    - **Search Topics**: Database isolation levels, locking mechanisms, transaction management.

### **Database Concepts:**

10. **Document-Based vs Relational Databases:**
    
    - **Document-Based**: No fixed schema, more flexible with nested data.
        
    - **Search Topics**: NoSQL databases, schema-less design, relational vs NoSQL databases.
        
11. **B+-Trees vs B-Trees:**
    
    - **B+-Trees**: More efficient for range queries and indexing with linked leaf nodes.
        
    - **Search Topics**: B-Trees, B+-Trees, database indexing structures.
        
12. **Soft Deletion in Databases:**
    
    - **Soft Deletion**: Marking records as deleted without physically removing them.
        
    - **Search Topics**: Soft delete pattern, database record management, data retention strategies.

### **Multithreading and Processes:**

13. **Race Condition vs Deadlock:**
    
    - **Race Condition**: When execution order affects the outcome.
        
    - **Deadlock**: When two or more threads wait for each other indefinitely.
        
    - **Search Topics**: Race conditions, deadlocks, concurrency issues.
        
14. **Thread Safety:**
    
    - **Thread Safety**: Ensuring data consistency when multiple threads access the same data.
        
    - **Search Topics**: Thread safety, multi-threaded programming, synchronization techniques.
        
15. **Process vs Thread:**
    
    - **Process**: Independent execution unit with its own address space.
        
    - **Thread**: A lightweight execution unit within a process, sharing the same address space.
        
    - **Search Topics**: Processes vs threads, thread management, multitasking.

### **Indexing and Query Optimization:**

16. **Indexes in Databases:**
    
    - **B+-Trees** and **Indexes**: Helps optimize query execution by organizing data for faster search.
        
    - **Search Topics**: SQL query optimization, database indexing, query execution plans.
