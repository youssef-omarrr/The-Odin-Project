## Summary  
The back end of a web application comprises three core components—the server, the application logic, and the database—and implements the request-response cycle over HTTP/REST. Clients (browsers, mobile apps, IoT devices) send requests (defined by an HTTP verb and URI), which the server routes through middleware functions in the app. These handlers may query a database or perform other processing before sending back a response (HTML, JSON, or status codes). A Web API is the set of endpoints and resources exposed by the back end, enabling multiple front-ends to consume the same data. Key principles include always issuing exactly one response per request and never having the server initiate communication unprompted. A concrete request flow (e.g., Alice fetching a product page) illustrates each step from client click to browser rendering.  ([Back-End Web Architecture | Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/article/back-end-architecture))

---

## What Are the Clients?  
- **Definition**: Any entity that makes requests to the back end—most commonly web browsers, but also mobile apps, smart appliances, or other servers.  ([Back-End Web Architecture | Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/article/back-end-architecture))  

---

## What Is the Back End?  
- **Components**:  
  1. **Server** – the machine (physical or virtual) that listens for and accepts incoming network requests.  
  2. **App** – the server-side code that routes requests, applies business logic, and formulates responses.  
  3. **Database** – the system that persistently stores and retrieves application data.  ([Back-End Web Architecture | Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/article/back-end-architecture))  

---

## The Server  
- **Role**: Any network-connected computer can act as a server; in development you often use your local machine. It continuously “listens” for incoming HTTP requests on designated ports.  ([Back-End Web Architecture | Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/article/back-end-architecture))  

---

## Core Functions of the App  
1. **Routing**  
   - A **route** is defined by an HTTP verb (GET, POST, etc.) plus a URI (e.g. `/products/123`).  
   - The framework (Express, Rails, etc.) matches incoming requests to the correct handler based on that verb-URI pair.  ([Back-End Web Architecture | Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/article/back-end-architecture))  
2. **Middleware**  
   - Middleware functions execute in sequence between receiving a request and sending a response.  
   - They can modify the request object, perform authentication, log activity, query databases, and then pass control to the next middleware rather than ending the cycle immediately.  ([Back-End Web Architecture | Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/article/back-end-architecture))  

---

## Types of Server Responses  
- **HTML files** for full-page loads.  
- **JSON** for data-only APIs.  
- **HTTP status codes** (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found) to indicate the result of the request without a body.  ([Back-End Web Architecture | Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/article/back-end-architecture))  

---

## Databases and Why We Need Them  
- **Definition**: An organized collection of data managed by a Database Management System (DBMS) that provides efficient, persistent storage and retrieval.  ([Database - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
- **Purpose**:  
  - Offloads data from server memory (CPU/RAM) to disk for persistence.  
  - Ensures data survives server restarts or crashes.  
  - Supports complex queries (filtering, sorting, joining).  ([Back-End Web Architecture | Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/article/back-end-architecture))  

---

## What Is a Web API?  
- **API**: A programming interface exposing methods for communication between software components  ([API - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
- **Web API**: The back end’s collection of URL endpoints (routes) and the resource representations (JSON/XML) it serves.  
- **Reusability**: One Web API can power multiple front-ends (websites, mobile apps, IoT devices) without dictating how data is presented.  ([Back-End Web Architecture | Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/article/back-end-architecture))  

---

## Other Request-Response Principles  
1. The server **cannot** initiate communication; it only replies to requests.  
2. Every request **must** receive exactly one response—even if it’s just a status code.  
3. Sending multiple responses to one request causes errors.  ([Back-End Web Architecture | Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/article/back-end-architecture))  

---

## Mapping Out a Request (Example Flow)  
1. **Client action**: Alice clicks a product image → GET `/products/66432`.  ([Back-End Web Architecture | Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/article/back-end-architecture))  
2. **Network**: Request travels across the internet to the closest server.  
3. **Server**: Listens and matches the route (GET + URI) → invokes middleware chain.  
4. **Database**: Middleware issues a query for product details (name, price, reviews, image path).  
5. **Response construction**: Server composes body (JSON/HTML) + status code 200.  
6. **Return trip**: Response travels back over the internet.  
7. **Client render**: Browser receives data and renders the product page.  ([Back-End Web Architecture | Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/article/back-end-architecture))  

---

**Recommended Review**  
- **HTTP/REST** conventions for structuring client-server communication.  ([Back-End Web Architecture | Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/article/back-end-architecture))  
- **Express**, **Ruby on Rails**, or other frameworks to see routing and middleware in action.

This collection of notes first introduces **what frameworks are** and why they exist, then defines **web frameworks** and their core features, and finally outlines **criteria for selecting a technology stack** based on real-world examples.

---

## 1. Introduction to Frameworks  
- A **framework** bundles together reusable code for common tasks so programmers don’t rewrite boilerplate logic every time they start a new project  ([
      Introduction to Frameworks | The Odin Project
    ](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-introduction-to-frameworks)).  
- Frameworks enforce a **project structure** (often following MVC principles) by providing preconfigured folders and files, which promotes modularity and cleaner code organization  ([
      Introduction to Frameworks | The Odin Project
    ](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-introduction-to-frameworks)).  
- Examples of popular frameworks span languages and domains: Ember, Meteor, Django, Rails (plus many more for Ruby such as Sinatra and Padrino)  ([
      Introduction to Frameworks | The Odin Project
    ](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-introduction-to-frameworks)).  

---

## 2. What Is a Web Framework?  
- A **web framework** (also called a web application framework) is a software framework designed to support the development of web applications, services, and APIs by automating common web-dev tasks  ([Web framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_framework?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
- Core capabilities usually include **routing** (mapping URLs to code handlers), **templating engines**, **database access libraries**, **session management**, and **middleware** for cross-cutting concerns like logging or authentication  ([Web framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_framework?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
- Frameworks follow an **“inversion of control”** pattern: they dictate the high-level flow and allow you to “hook into” predefined lifecycle events rather than calling your code directly  ([Web framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_framework?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
- By using a web framework you gain:  
  1. **Convention over configuration**, reducing the number of decisions you must make.  
  2. **Built-in security** features and best-practice defaults.  
  3. **Community-maintained plugins** or modules for common needs (e.g., OAuth integration, testing suites)  ([Web framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_framework?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  

---

## 3. Technology Stack for Web Development  
RubyGarage outlines five primary criteria for choosing your stack, plus real-world examples of what the top sites use:  

### 3.1 Criteria for Selecting a Stack  
1. **Type of application**: CPU-intensive apps (e.g., video streaming) favor languages/frameworks optimized for heavy loads; low-latency apps (e.g., social feeds) need stacks with minimal response times  ([
Web Application Development Technology Stack
](https://rubygarage.org/blog/technology-stack-for-web-development)).  
2. **Time to market (TTM)**:  
   - Look for **out-of-the-box** solutions (gems or packages) that speed up development.  
   - Ensure smooth **third-party integrations** so you avoid reinventing wheels.  
   - Consider **developer availability**: picking a niche stack may make hiring costly or slow.  
   - Verify strong **documentation and community** support to troubleshoot tricky issues quickly  ([
Web Application Development Technology Stack
](https://rubygarage.org/blog/technology-stack-for-web-development)).  
3. **Development cost**:  
   - **Salaries** vary by technology proficiency; more specialized stacks often command higher pay.  
   - **Maintenance costs** favor open-source frameworks (e.g., Rails under MIT) that incur no licensing fees  ([
Web Application Development Technology Stack
](https://rubygarage.org/blog/technology-stack-for-web-development)).  
4. **Security**: Ensure your chosen stack has clear, maintained **security guidelines** and a track record of rapid patching for vulnerabilities  ([
Web Application Development Technology Stack
](https://rubygarage.org/blog/technology-stack-for-web-development)).  
5. **Scalability**:  
   - **Horizontal** (adding servers) and **vertical** (adding features) scalability must align with your projected growth.  
   - Base decisions on concrete case studies rather than hearsay  ([
Web Application Development Technology Stack
](https://rubygarage.org/blog/technology-stack-for-web-development)).  

### [3.2 Real-World Tech Stacks ](https://rubygarage.org/blog/technology-stack-for-web-development#article_title_15) 
- **Airbnb** and **Shopify** both rely heavily on **Ruby on Rails** for rapid feature development and a mature ecosystem  ([
Web Application Development Technology Stack
](https://rubygarage.org/blog/technology-stack-for-web-development)).  
- **Quora** uses a mixed stack but is widely known for its **Python**-based backend  ([
Web Application Development Technology Stack
](https://rubygarage.org/blog/technology-stack-for-web-development)).  
- **Instagram** was originally built on **Django** (Python) to leverage its quick prototyping and scalability  ([
Web Application Development Technology Stack
](https://rubygarage.org/blog/technology-stack-for-web-development)).  
- **Codecademy** combines **Ruby**, **Python**, and JavaScript technologies to serve interactive lessons across languages  ([
Web Application Development Technology Stack
](https://rubygarage.org/blog/technology-stack-for-web-development)).

Node.js is a **cross-platform**, **open-source** JavaScript **runtime environment** built on Chrome’s V8 engine that lets you run JavaScript outside the browser to build scalable network applications. It uses an **asynchronous**, **event-driven** architecture (the Event Loop) to handle I/O without blocking, and provides built-in modules for file system access, HTTP servers, and more—enabling you to write server-side code in JavaScript. Below you’ll find the core definitions, key features, the event-driven model, a minimal “Hello World” example, and pointers to further learning.  

---

## Definition: What Is Node?  
- **Official definition**:  
  > “As an asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime, Node is designed to build scalable network applications.”  ([
      Introduction: What is NodeJS? | The Odin Project
    ](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-introduction-what-is-nodejs))  
- **Runtime environment**: JavaScript was originally confined to browsers; Node.js brings it to your machine or server, enabling everything from web servers to CLI tools  ([
      Introduction: What is NodeJS? | The Odin Project
    ](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-introduction-what-is-nodejs)) and  ([Node.js — Run JavaScript Everywhere](https://nodejs.org/en?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
- **Built on V8**: Uses Google’s V8 engine (the same engine powering Chrome) to compile JS into machine code for high performance  ([Node.js - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  

---

## Node’s Core Capabilities  
1. **File system access**: Read/write local files directly via built-in `fs` module  ([
      Introduction: What is NodeJS? | The Odin Project
    ](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-introduction-what-is-nodejs)).  
2. **HTTP server**: Create and listen to HTTP connections out of the box via `http` module  ([
      Introduction: What is NodeJS? | The Odin Project
    ](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-introduction-what-is-nodejs)).  
3. **Networking**: Low-level TCP/UDP support through `net` and `dgram` modules.  
4. **Package management**: Ships with **npm**, the world’s largest package registry, to install and manage dependencies  ([Node.js - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
5. **Cross-platform**: Runs on Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD, and more  ([Node.js](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  

---

## Asynchronous, Event-Driven Model  
- **Event Loop**: Node schedules I/O tasks (file read, DB query, network request) and immediately continues executing other code; when the I/O completes, it emits an event invoking its callback handler  ([
      Introduction: What is NodeJS? | The Odin Project
    ](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-introduction-what-is-nodejs)).  
- **Callbacks**: Functions passed as arguments that Node invokes upon event completion (e.g., file read or HTTP response)  ([
      Introduction: What is NodeJS? | The Odin Project
    ](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-introduction-what-is-nodejs)).  
- **Non-blocking**: Unlike synchronous code that waits for each step, Node can handle thousands of concurrent connections by never blocking the main thread on I/O  ([
      Introduction: What is NodeJS? | The Odin Project
    ](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-introduction-what-is-nodejs)) and  ([About Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  

---

## “Hello World” Example  
```js
const http = require('http');

http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
  res.end('Hello World!');
}).listen(8080);
```
- **Explanation**:  
  1. `http.createServer(...)` sets up a server that runs the callback on each incoming request.  
  2. `res.writeHead(200, ...)` sends an HTTP 200 status with headers.  
  3. `res.end('Hello World!')` finishes the response with a body.  
  4. `.listen(8080)` tells Node to listen on port 8080  ([
      Introduction: What is NodeJS? | The Odin Project
    ](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-introduction-what-is-nodejs)).  
- **Concurrency**: This single-threaded server can still handle many clients simultaneously thanks to its event-driven design  ([About Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  

---

## When to Use (and Not Use) a Back End  
- **Use a back end** when you need persistent data storage, authentication, or business logic (e-commerce, social apps, data-driven sites).  ([
      Introduction: What is NodeJS? | The Odin Project
    ](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-introduction-what-is-nodejs))  
- **Skip the back end** for purely static sites (brochure sites, simple landing pages)—you can host HTML/CSS/JS without Node.  ([
      Introduction: What is NodeJS? | The Odin Project
    ](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-introduction-what-is-nodejs))
